# Comment-Toxicity-Model

Here, we perform toxic comment detection using deep learning, specifically leveraging an LSTM and bidirectional model. While we initially trained the model for just one epoch, the results were highly promising. However, there is significant potential for improvement by increasing the number of epochs to 10 or more, which could further enhance the model's performance.
